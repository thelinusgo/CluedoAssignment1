# CluedoAssignment1
This assignment involved creating an object-oriented implementation of the Cluedo board Game from scratch, for our SWEN 222 Assignment. It is completely text based, providing user input and output through Java's System.in utility. I worked with a partner, Casey Huang for this assignment.We delegated the work in half, where I designed and planned out the classes and programmed the base code, and Casey helped fix my mistakes (thanks!) and implemented the trickier problems, such as player movement, drawing out the board, and figuring out when a game has been won or lost.

We obtained full marks (A+) for this assignment.
